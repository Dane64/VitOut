## How to play:
Try to destroy all the bricks as fast as possible and with the least lives lost.

Bricks with darker core need 2-6 hits to be destoyed
Bricks with one solid color dissapear with one hit

In the level selector is the highscore per level visible (in the gif example lvl 6 has 3 golden balls and lvl 5 has no score yet)
